# SYMPOSIUM OF ATTENTION AND PERCEPTION IN XR (HYBRID) 
## 20 – 21 June 2024
Organised by XR and Attention Research Group and supported by the Centre for Attention 
Studies, King’s College London, the symposium on Attention and Perception in 
XR (Extended Reality) is a hybrid event that combines presentations, discussions, immersive 
project showcases, and networking activities across two days. It brings together scholars and 
creatives to discuss the problem of attention and perception in XR, and explore what XR means for 
us at this present historical and technical moment. Structured around three intersecting themes, the 
symposium seeks to open up discussion and further research into the physiological and socio
cultural mechanisms of making and shaping attention in and with XR; into how we might use those 
to make XR spaces more body-caring and human-centred and how performing arts might inform the 
design of those spaces; and, last but not least, into how we might reshape the knowledge of cultural 
heritage and create new centres of attention across disciplinary boundaries.
